Web Analyzer – Intelligent Web Content Summarizer & QA
🔎 Project Overview

Web Analyzer is an interactive tool that extracts, summarizes, and answers questions from any website. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP models to provide fast insights from articles, blogs, or online documents.

This project is ideal for researchers, students, or professionals who want to quickly understand web content without reading the full page.

⚡ Features
Question Answering: Ask questions about the website content and get instant answers.

Interactive Interface: Built with Gradio for an easy-to-use web UI.

Supports Any Website: Works with any publicly accessible webpage using BeautifulSoup.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Transformers (Hugging Face) – BERT-based Question Answering

Sentence Transformers – Semantic search embeddings

FAISS – Fast vector similarity search

BeautifulSoup & Requests – Web scraping

Gradio – Interactive web interface

NLTK – Text preprocessing and tokenization

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-analyzer.git
cd web-analyzer

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application
python app.py


The Gradio interface will open in your browser.

Enter a website URL, then either summarize or ask questions about the content.


💡 How it Works

Web Scraping: Fetch HTML content using requests and parse text with BeautifulSoup.

Text Chunking: Split the text into manageable chunks.

Embedding & Search: Encode chunks into vectors using Sentence Transformers and store in FAISS index.

Question Answering: Use a BERT QA model to find the best answer from relevant chunks.

Interactive Output: Display results in a Gradio interface for easy access.
